## Summary

Overall, the Citibike Analysis indicates there is enough data to construct a bike-sharing program in Des Moines with key information on popular checkout durations and times of day. Further analysis could be accomplished in 2 ways. First, one could bring in demographic data like age to determine the median age range for optimal marketing efforts. Second, one could analyze the average distance, since New York is a more densely populated and less spread out area than Des Moines.
